List of the violated restraints:
   A restraint is violated when the relative difference
   from the best value (RVIOL) is larger than CUTOFF.

   ICSR   ... index of a restraint in the current set.
   RESNO  ... residue numbers of the first two atoms.
   ATM    ... IUPAC atom names of the first two atoms.
   FEAT   ... the value of the feature in the model.
   restr  ... the mean of the basis restraint with the smallest
              difference from the model (local minimum).
   viol   ... difference from the local minimum.
   rviol  ... relative difference from the local minimum.
   RESTR  ... the best value (global minimum).
   VIOL   ... difference from the best value.
   RVIOL  ... relative difference from the best value.

List of the violated restraints:
   A restraint is violated when the relative difference
   from the best value (RVIOL) is larger than CUTOFF.

   ICSR   ... index of a restraint in the current set.
   RESNO  ... residue numbers of the first two atoms.
   ATM    ... IUPAC atom names of the first two atoms.
   FEAT   ... the value of the feature in the model.
   restr  ... the mean of the basis restraint with the smallest
              difference from the model (local minimum).
   viol   ... difference from the local minimum.
   rviol  ... relative difference from the local minimum.
   RESTR  ... the best value (global minimum).
   VIOL   ... difference from the best value.
   RVIOL  ... relative difference from the best value.

List of the violated restraints:
   A restraint is violated when the relative difference
   from the best value (RVIOL) is larger than CUTOFF.

   ICSR   ... index of a restraint in the current set.
   RESNO  ... residue numbers of the first two atoms.
   ATM    ... IUPAC atom names of the first two atoms.
   FEAT   ... the value of the feature in the model.
   restr  ... the mean of the basis restraint with the smallest
              difference from the model (local minimum).
   viol   ... difference from the local minimum.
   rviol  ... relative difference from the local minimum.
   RESTR  ... the best value (global minimum).
   VIOL   ... difference from the best value.
   RVIOL  ... relative difference from the best value.

   ATM    ... IUPAC atom names of the first two atoms.
   FEAT   ... the value of the feature in the model.
   restr  ... the mean of the basis restraint with the smallest
              difference from the model (local minimum).
   viol   ... difference from the local minimum.
   rviol  ... relative difference from the local minimum.
   RESTR  ... the best value (global minimum).
   VIOL   ... difference from the best value.
   RVIOL  ... relative difference from the best value.

List of the violated restraints:
   A restraint is violated when the relative difference
   from the best value (RVIOL) is larger than CUTOFF.

   ICSR   ... index of a restraint in the current set.
   RESNO  ... residue numbers of the first two atoms.
   ATM    ... IUPAC atom names of the first two atoms.
   FEAT   ... the value of the feature in the model.
   restr  ... the mean of the basis restraint with the smallest
              difference from the model (local minimum).
   viol   ... difference from the local minimum.
   rviol  ... relative difference from the local minimum.
   RESTR  ... the best value (global minimum).
   VIOL   ... difference from the best value.
   RVIOL  ... relative difference from the best value.

   A restraint is violated when the relative difference
   from the best value (RVIOL) is larger than CUTOFF.

   ICSR   ... index of a restraint in the current set.
   RESNO  ... residue numbers of the first two atoms.
   ATM    ... IUPAC atom names of the first two atoms.
   FEAT   ... the value of the feature in the model.
   restr  ... the mean of the basis restraint with the smallest
              difference from the model (local minimum).
   viol   ... difference from the local minimum.
   rviol  ... relative difference from the local minimum.
   RESTR  ... the best value (global minimum).
   VIOL   ... difference from the best value.
   RVIOL  ... relative difference from the best value.

List of the violated restraints:
   A restraint is violated when the relative difference
   from the best value (RVIOL) is larger than CUTOFF.

   ICSR   ... index of a restraint in the current set.
   RESNO  ... residue numbers of the first two atoms.
   ATM    ... IUPAC atom names of the first two atoms.
   FEAT   ... the value of the feature in the model.
   restr  ... the mean of the basis restraint with the smallest
              difference from the model (local minimum).
   viol   ... difference from the local minimum.
   rviol  ... relative difference from the local minimum.
   RESTR  ... the best value (global minimum).
   VIOL   ... difference from the best value.
   RVIOL  ... relative difference from the best value.

List of the violated restraints:
   A restraint is violated when the relative difference
   from the best value (RVIOL) is larger than CUTOFF.

   ICSR   ... index of a restraint in the current set.
   RESNO  ... residue numbers of the first two atoms.
   ATM    ... IUPAC atom names of the first two atoms.
   FEAT   ... the value of the feature in the model.
   restr  ... the mean of the basis restraint with the smallest
              difference from the model (local minimum).
   viol   ... difference from the local minimum.
   rviol  ... relative difference from the local minimum.
   RESTR  ... the best value (global minimum).
   VIOL   ... difference from the best value.
   RVIOL  ... relative difference from the best value.

   ATM    ... IUPAC atom names of the first two atoms.
   FEAT   ... the value of the feature in the model.
   restr  ... the mean of the basis restraint with the smallest
              difference from the model (local minimum).
   viol   ... difference from the local minimum.
   rviol  ... relative difference from the local minimum.
   RESTR  ... the best value (global minimum).
   VIOL   ... difference from the best value.
   RVIOL  ... relative difference from the best value.

List of the violated restraints:
   A restraint is violated when the relative difference
   from the best value (RVIOL) is larger than CUTOFF.

   ICSR   ... index of a restraint in the current set.
   RESNO  ... residue numbers of the first two atoms.
   ATM    ... IUPAC atom names of the first two atoms.
   FEAT   ... the value of the feature in the model.
   restr  ... the mean of the basis restraint with the smallest
              difference from the model (local minimum).
   viol   ... difference from the local minimum.
   rviol  ... relative difference from the local minimum.
   RESTR  ... the best value (global minimum).
   VIOL   ... difference from the best value.
   RVIOL  ... relative difference from the best value.

   ATM    ... IUPAC atom names of the first two atoms.
   FEAT   ... the value of the feature in the model.
   restr  ... the mean of the basis restraint with the smallest
              difference from the model (local minimum).
   viol   ... difference from the local minimum.
   rviol  ... relative difference from the local minimum.
   RESTR  ... the best value (global minimum).
   VIOL   ... difference from the best value.

List of the violated restraints:
   A restraint is violated when the relative difference
   from the best value (RVIOL) is larger than CUTOFF.

   ICSR   ... index of a restraint in the current set.
   RESNO  ... residue numbers of the first two atoms.
   ATM    ... IUPAC atom names of the first two atoms.
   FEAT   ... the value of the feature in the model.
   restr  ... the mean of the basis restraint with the smallest
              difference from the model (local minimum).
   viol   ... difference from the local minimum.
   rviol  ... relative difference from the local minimum.
   RESTR  ... the best value (global minimum).
   VIOL   ... difference from the best value.

   ATM    ... IUPAC atom names of the first two atoms.
   FEAT   ... the value of the feature in the model.
   restr  ... the mean of the basis restraint with the smallest
              difference from the model (local minimum).
   viol   ... difference from the local minimum.
   rviol  ... relative difference from the local minimum.
   RESTR  ... the best value (global minimum).
   VIOL   ... difference from the best value.
   RVIOL  ... relative difference from the best value.

List of the violated restraints:
   A restraint is violated when the relative difference
   from the best value (RVIOL) is larger than CUTOFF.

   ICSR   ... index of a restraint in the current set.
   RESNO  ... residue numbers of the first two atoms.
   ATM    ... IUPAC atom names of the first two atoms.
   FEAT   ... the value of the feature in the model.
   restr  ... the mean of the basis restraint with the smallest
              difference from the model (local minimum).
   viol   ... difference from the local minimum.
   rviol  ... relative difference from the local minimum.
   RESTR  ... the best value (global minimum).
   VIOL   ... difference from the best value.
   RVIOL  ... relative difference from the best value.

List of the violated restraints:
   A restraint is violated when the relative difference
   from the best value (RVIOL) is larger than CUTOFF.

   ICSR   ... index of a restraint in the current set.
   RESNO  ... residue numbers of the first two atoms.
   ATM    ... IUPAC atom names of the first two atoms.
   FEAT   ... the value of the feature in the model.
   restr  ... the mean of the basis restraint with the smallest
              difference from the model (local minimum).
   viol   ... difference from the local minimum.
   rviol  ... relative difference from the local minimum.
   RESTR  ... the best value (global minimum).
   VIOL   ... difference from the best value.
   RVIOL  ... relative difference from the best value.

   A restraint is violated when the relative difference
   from the best value (RVIOL) is larger than CUTOFF.

   ICSR   ... index of a restraint in the current set.
   RESNO  ... residue numbers of the first two atoms.
   ATM    ... IUPAC atom names of the first two atoms.
   FEAT   ... the value of the feature in the model.
   restr  ... the mean of the basis restraint with the smallest
              difference from the model (local minimum).
   viol   ... difference from the local minimum.
   rviol  ... relative difference from the local minimum.
   RESTR  ... the best value (global minimum).
   VIOL   ... difference from the best value.
   RVIOL  ... relative difference from the best value.

List of the violated restraints:
   A restraint is violated when the relative difference
   from the best value (RVIOL) is larger than CUTOFF.

   ICSR   ... index of a restraint in the current set.
   RESNO  ... residue numbers of the first two atoms.
   ATM    ... IUPAC atom names of the first two atoms.
   FEAT   ... the value of the feature in the model.
   restr  ... the mean of the basis restraint with the smallest
              difference from the model (local minimum).
   viol   ... difference from the local minimum.
   rviol  ... relative difference from the local minimum.
   RESTR  ... the best value (global minimum).
   VIOL   ... difference from the best value.
   RVIOL  ... relative difference from the best value.

List of the violated restraints:
   A restraint is violated when the relative difference
   from the best value (RVIOL) is larger than CUTOFF.

   ICSR   ... index of a restraint in the current set.
   RESNO  ... residue numbers of the first two atoms.
   ATM    ... IUPAC atom names of the first two atoms.
   FEAT   ... the value of the feature in the model.
   restr  ... the mean of the basis restraint with the smallest
              difference from the model (local minimum).
   viol   ... difference from the local minimum.
   rviol  ... relative difference from the local minimum.
   RESTR  ... the best value (global minimum).
   VIOL   ... difference from the best value.
   RVIOL  ... relative difference from the best value.

   A restraint is violated when the relative difference
   from the best value (RVIOL) is larger than CUTOFF.

   ICSR   ... index of a restraint in the current set.
   RESNO  ... residue numbers of the first two atoms.
   ATM    ... IUPAC atom names of the first two atoms.
   FEAT   ... the value of the feature in the model.
   restr  ... the mean of the basis restraint with the smallest
              difference from the model (local minimum).
   viol   ... difference from the local minimum.
   rviol  ... relative difference from the local minimum.
   RESTR  ... the best value (global minimum).
   VIOL   ... difference from the best value.
   RVIOL  ... relative difference from the best value.

List of the violated restraints:
   A restraint is violated when the relative difference
   from the best value (RVIOL) is larger than CUTOFF.

   ICSR   ... index of a restraint in the current set.
   RESNO  ... residue numbers of the first two atoms.
   ATM    ... IUPAC atom names of the first two atoms.
   FEAT   ... the value of the feature in the model.
   restr  ... the mean of the basis restraint with the smallest
              difference from the model (local minimum).
   viol   ... difference from the local minimum.
   rviol  ... relative difference from the local minimum.
   RESTR  ... the best value (global minimum).
   VIOL   ... difference from the best value.
   RVIOL  ... relative difference from the best value.

List of the violated restraints:
   A restraint is violated when the relative difference
   from the best value (RVIOL) is larger than CUTOFF.

   ICSR   ... index of a restraint in the current set.
   RESNO  ... residue numbers of the first two atoms.
   ATM    ... IUPAC atom names of the first two atoms.
   FEAT   ... the value of the feature in the model.
   restr  ... the mean of the basis restraint with the smallest
              difference from the model (local minimum).
   viol   ... difference from the local minimum.
   rviol  ... relative difference from the local minimum.
   RESTR  ... the best value (global minimum).
   VIOL   ... difference from the best value.
   RVIOL  ... relative difference from the best value.

List of the violated restraints:
   A restraint is violated when the relative difference
   from the best value (RVIOL) is larger than CUTOFF.

   ICSR   ... index of a restraint in the current set.
   RESNO  ... residue numbers of the first two atoms.
   ATM    ... IUPAC atom names of the first two atoms.
   FEAT   ... the value of the feature in the model.
   restr  ... the mean of the basis restraint with the smallest
              difference from the model (local minimum).
   viol   ... difference from the local minimum.
   rviol  ... relative difference from the local minimum.
   RESTR  ... the best value (global minimum).
   VIOL   ... difference from the best value.
   RVIOL  ... relative difference from the best value.

List of the violated restraints:
   A restraint is violated when the relative difference
   from the best value (RVIOL) is larger than CUTOFF.

   ICSR   ... index of a restraint in the current set.
   RESNO  ... residue numbers of the first two atoms.
   ATM    ... IUPAC atom names of the first two atoms.
   FEAT   ... the value of the feature in the model.
   restr  ... the mean of the basis restraint with the smallest
              difference from the model (local minimum).
   viol   ... difference from the local minimum.
   rviol  ... relative difference from the local minimum.
   RESTR  ... the best value (global minimum).
   VIOL   ... difference from the best value.
   RVIOL  ... relative difference from the best value.

   ATM    ... IUPAC atom names of the first two atoms.
   FEAT   ... the value of the feature in the model.
   restr  ... the mean of the basis restraint with the smallest
              difference from the model (local minimum).
   viol   ... difference from the local minimum.
   rviol  ... relative difference from the local minimum.
   RESTR  ... the best value (global minimum).
   VIOL   ... difference from the best value.
   RVIOL  ... relative difference from the best value.

   A restraint is violated when the relative difference
   from the best value (RVIOL) is larger than CUTOFF.

   ICSR   ... index of a restraint in the current set.
   RESNO  ... residue numbers of the first two atoms.
   ATM    ... IUPAC atom names of the first two atoms.
   FEAT   ... the value of the feature in the model.
   restr  ... the mean of the basis restraint with the smallest
              difference from the model (local minimum).
   viol   ... difference from the local minimum.
   rviol  ... relative difference from the local minimum.
   RESTR  ... the best value (global minimum).
   VIOL   ... difference from the best value.
   RVIOL  ... relative difference from the best value.

List of the violated restraints:
   A restraint is violated when the relative difference
   from the best value (RVIOL) is larger than CUTOFF.

   ICSR   ... index of a restraint in the current set.
   RESNO  ... residue numbers of the first two atoms.
   ATM    ... IUPAC atom names of the first two atoms.
   FEAT   ... the value of the feature in the model.
   restr  ... the mean of the basis restraint with the smallest
              difference from the model (local minimum).
   viol   ... difference from the local minimum.
   rviol  ... relative difference from the local minimum.
   RESTR  ... the best value (global minimum).
   VIOL   ... difference from the best value.
   RVIOL  ... relative difference from the best value.

List of the violated restraints:
   A restraint is violated when the relative difference
   from the best value (RVIOL) is larger than CUTOFF.

   ICSR   ... index of a restraint in the current set.
   RESNO  ... residue numbers of the first two atoms.
   ATM    ... IUPAC atom names of the first two atoms.
   FEAT   ... the value of the feature in the model.
   restr  ... the mean of the basis restraint with the smallest
              difference from the model (local minimum).
   viol   ... difference from the local minimum.
   rviol  ... relative difference from the local minimum.
   RESTR  ... the best value (global minimum).
   VIOL   ... difference from the best value.
   RVIOL  ... relative difference from the best value.

List of the violated restraints:
   A restraint is violated when the relative difference
   from the best value (RVIOL) is larger than CUTOFF.

   ICSR   ... index of a restraint in the current set.
   RESNO  ... residue numbers of the first two atoms.
   ATM    ... IUPAC atom names of the first two atoms.
   FEAT   ... the value of the feature in the model.
   restr  ... the mean of the basis restraint with the smallest
              difference from the model (local minimum).
   viol   ... difference from the local minimum.
   rviol  ... relative difference from the local minimum.
   RESTR  ... the best value (global minimum).
   VIOL   ... difference from the best value.
   RVIOL  ... relative difference from the best value.
